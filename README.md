# Lido Gnosis Safe App

Lido is the liquid staking solution for Ethereum. This app is intended for
Gnosis Safe. Its sole feature is to enable Gnosis safe owners to stake ETH with
Lido.

When staking with Lido, users receive stETH tokens on a 1:1 basis representing
their staked ETH. stETH balances can be used like regular ETH to earn yields and
lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your ETH staking
rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups or minimum deposits when staking with
Lido.

When using Lido, users receive secure staking rewards in real-time, allowing for
participation in the securing of Ethereum without the associated risks and
downside potential.
